### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I acknowledge every humanâ€™s uniqueness. This helps me develop workable and practical solutions to real-world problems.

Empathy. Psychology. Education.
If you cut me open, you will find these three elements at my core. Conversations and activities around them set me on fire. My philosophical approach to problem solving sets me apart.
